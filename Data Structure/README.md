# Data Structure Problems
## 1. Check brackets in the code Problem
In this problem you will implement a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the
code.  
- **Input format**. Input contains one string 𝑆 which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation
marks and brackets from the set []{}().  
- **Output format**. If the code in 𝑆 uses brackets correctly, output “Success" (without the quotes). Otherwise,
output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing
brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.  
- **Constraints**. The length of 𝑆 is at least 1 and at most 10** 5.

## 2. Compute tree height Problem
You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall
that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance from a
leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.
- **Input format**. The first line contains the number of nodes 𝑛. The second line contains 𝑛 integer numbers
from −1 to 𝑛 − 1 — parents of nodes. If the 𝑖-th one of them (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1) is −1, node 𝑖 is the root,
otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of 𝑖-th node. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one root.
It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.  
- **Output format**. Output the height of the tree.  
- **Constraints**. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10** 5.

## 3. Convert array into heap Problem
The first step of the HeapSort algorithm is to create a heap from the array you want to sort. By the
way, did you know that algorithms based on Heaps are widely used for external sort, when you need
to sort huge files that don’t fit into memory of a computer?
Your task is to implement this first step and convert a given array of integers into a heap. You will
do that by applying a certain number of swaps to the array. Swap is an operation which exchanges
elements 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑎𝑗 of the array 𝑎 for some 𝑖 and 𝑗. You will need to convert the array into a heap using
only 𝑂(𝑛) swaps, as was described in the lectures. Note that you will need to use a min-heap instead
of a max-heap in this problem.
- **Input format**. The first line of the input contains single integer 𝑛. The next line contains 𝑛 space-separated
integers 𝑎𝑖.  
- **Output format**. The first line of the output should contain single integer 𝑚 — the total number of swaps.
𝑚 must satisfy conditions 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 4𝑛. The next 𝑚 lines should contain the swap operations used
to convert the array 𝑎 into a heap. Each swap is described by a pair of integers 𝑖, 𝑗 — the 0-based
indices of the elements to be swapped. After applying all the swaps in the specified order the array
must become a heap, that is, for each 𝑖 where 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 the following conditions must be true:
1. If 2𝑖 + 1 ≤ 𝑛 − 1, then 𝑎𝑖 < 𝑎2𝑖+1.
2. If 2𝑖 + 2 ≤ 𝑛 − 1, then 𝑎𝑖 < 𝑎2𝑖+2.
Note that all the elements of the input array are distinct. Note that any sequence of swaps that has
length at most 4𝑛 and after which your initial array becomes a correct heap will be graded as correct.  
- **Constraints**. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100 000; 0 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1; 0 ≤ 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1 ≤ 10** 9. All 𝑎𝑖 are distinct.

## 4. Merging tables Problem
There are 𝑛 tables stored in some database. The tables are numbered from 1 to 𝑛. All tables share
the same set of columns. Each table contains either several rows with real data or a symbolic link to
another table. Initially, all tables contain data, and 𝑖-th table has 𝑟𝑖 rows. You need to perform 𝑚 of
the following operations:
1. Consider table number 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖. Traverse the path of symbolic links to get to the data. That is,
while 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 contains a symbolic link instead of real data do
𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 ← symlink(𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖)
2. Consider the table number 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 and traverse the path of symbolic links from it in the same
manner as for 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖.
3. Now, 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 and 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 are the numbers of two tables with real data. If 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 ̸=
𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖, copy all the rows from table 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 to table 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖, then clear the table 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖
and instead of real data put a symbolic link to 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 into it.
4. Print the maximum size among all 𝑛 tables (recall that size is the number of rows in the table).
If the table contains only a symbolic link, its size is considered to be 0.
- **Input format**. The first line of the input contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 — the number of tables in the
database and the number of merge queries to perform, respectively.
The second line of the input contains 𝑛 integers 𝑟𝑖 — the number of rows in the 𝑖-th table.
Then follow 𝑚 lines describing merge queries. Each of them contains two integers 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 and
𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 — the numbers of the tables to merge.  
- **Output format**. For each query print a line containing a single integer — the maximum of the sizes of all
tables (in terms of the number of rows) after the corresponding operation.  
- **Constraints**. 1 ≤ 𝑛,𝑚 ≤ 100 000; 0 ≤ 𝑟𝑖 ≤ 10 000; 1 ≤ 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖, 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 ≤ 𝑛.

## 5. Phone book Problem
In this task your goal is to implement a simple phone book manager. It should be able to process the
following types of user’s queries:  
∙ add number name. It means that the user adds a person with name name and phone number
number to the phone book. If there exists a user with such number already, then your manager
has to overwrite the corresponding name.  
∙ del number. It means that the manager should erase a person with number number from the phone
book. If there is no such person, then it should just ignore the query.  
∙ find number. It means that the user looks for a person with phone number number. The manager
should reply with the appropriate name, or with string “not found" (without quotes) if there is
no such person in the book.  
- **Input format**. There is a single integer 𝑁 in the first line — the number of queries. It’s followed by 𝑁
lines, each of them contains one query in the format described above.  
- **Output format**. Print the result of each find query — the name corresponding to the phone number or
“not found" (without quotes) if there is no person in the phone book with such phone number. Output
one result per line in the same order as the find queries are given in the input.  
- **Constraints**. 1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10** 5. All phone numbers consist of decimal digits, they don’t have leading zeros, and
each of them has no more than 7 digits. All names are non-empty strings of latin letters, and each of
them has length at most 15. It’s guaranteed that there is no person with name “not found".

## 6. Hashing with chains Problem
In this task your goal is to implement a hash table with lists chaining. You are already given the
number of buckets 𝑚 and the hash function. It is a polynomial hash function
ℎ(𝑆) =
(
|𝑆Σ︁|−1
𝑖=0
𝑆[𝑖]𝑥𝑖 mod 𝑝
) mod 𝑚,
where 𝑆[𝑖] is the ASCII code of the 𝑖-th symbol of 𝑆, 𝑝 = 1 000 000 007 and 𝑥 = 263. Your program
should support the following kinds of queries:
∙ add string — insert string into the table. If there is already such string in the hash table, then
just ignore the query.
∙ del string — remove string from the table. If there is no such string in the hash table, then
just ignore the query.
∙ find string — output “yes" or “no" (without quotes) depending on whether the table contains
string or not.
∙ check 𝑖 — output the content of the 𝑖-th list in the table. Use spaces to separate the elements of
the list. If 𝑖-th list is empty, output a blank line.
When inserting a new string into a hash chain, you must insert it in the beginning of the chain.
- **Input format**. There is a single integer 𝑚 in the first line — the number of buckets you should have. The
next line contains the number of queries 𝑁. It’s followed by 𝑁 lines, each of them contains one query
in the format described above.  
- **Output format**. Print the result of each of the find and check queries, one result per line, in the same
order as these queries are given in the input.  
- **Constraints**. 1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10** 5; 𝑁
5 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑁. All the strings consist of latin letters. Each of them is non-empty
and has length at most 15.
